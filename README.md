### hi there
I'm busybox(11), a 15yo French student, but also tech addict.
I like programming (especially in Python, but I also do a bit of JS), web designing (HTML, CSS), but I'm also a (not professional) graphic designer (using Figma most of the time).

## here are some of my projects.
- [NowPlaying for Spotify](https://github.com/busybox11/NowPlaying-for-Spotify), a modern-looking Spotify visualizer, available at [nowplaying.ga](https://nowplaying.ga)
- [Probote](https://github.com/busybox11/probote), a Discord bot for Pronote notifications (a french school management website)
- [My Linux dotfiles](https://github.com/busybox11/dotfiles), as long as my [polybar config](https://github.com/busybox11/spotify-polybar)
- [My portfolio](https://github.com/busybox11/busybox11.github.io), available at [busybox11.github.io](https://busybox11.github.io)
- [blockr](https://github.com/busybox11/blockr), a WIP ads and page blocker browser extension
